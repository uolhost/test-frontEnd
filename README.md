# UOL Test Front End

I am using Express to serve the user.json file to be consumed by the React in client side.
You can see a live example at : http://uol.esdrasrios.me/

## How to use

First of all, make sure you have Node 8.9.3 installed. Then, install all the dependencies:

```bash
$ npm 
```

Start both the server and client (with auto reload whenever a file changes):

```bash
$ npm run dev
```
